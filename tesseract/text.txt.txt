Fuel Efficiency Is the Key to a Better Life

As the price of gas keeps getting higher and higher, so does
the demand of alternative power sources. Though the vehicles we
drive now have been good enough for the past 100 years, they
are not efficient enough for our needs today. We need to find
new ways to create fuel efficient vehicles. Whether it is gasoline,
battery, hydrogen, solar, or even wind powered, we must find
alternative ways to increase gas mileage. The benefits of
increasing gas mileage would be a healthier environment, a boost
in the economy, and help for families across the United States.
Our current vehicles are not acceptable in any of these
categories.

Using more fuel efficient cars would be a lot easier on the
environment. The cars that are on the roads today spit out all
kinds of harmful emissions. If we were to increase the fuel
efficiency of those cars then the emissions output would be
greatly decreased. One way to increase gas mileage would be to
find an alternative power source for the vehicles. For instance, if
we were to use hydrogen to power our vehicles, the only thing
that would come out of the exhaust pipes would be all natural
H20, also known as water. I know you're probably thinking that
coming up with a way to power a vehicle with hydrogen would be
a very difficult task, if not all together impossible. But the truth is
that engineers are getting very close to solving that problem.
Some car companies have already developed a _ hydrogen
powered car. Though they donâ€™t have all the bugs worked out
yet, they have made a very promising start towards using
hydrogen power.

Another reason that fuel mileage should be increased is
because, in more than one way, it would boost our economy. As
of right now our economy is slowly sliding into a recession. If
congress were to pass a law requiring that all vehicles being
